<p>Exceptions handlers (<code>catch</code>) are evaluated in the order they are written. Once a match is found, the evaluation stops.</p>
<p>In some contexts a <code>catch</code> block is dead code as it will never catch any exception:</p>
<ul>
  <li> If there is a handler for a base class followed by a handler for class derived from that base class, the second handler will never trigger: the
  handler for the base class will match the derived class, and will be the only executed handler. </li>
  <li> When multiple <code>catch</code> blocks try to catch the same exception class, only the first one will be executed. </li>
</ul>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a <code>catch</code> block catches every exception before a later <code>catch</code> block could catch it.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
class MyException extends Exception {}
class MySubException extends MyException {}

try {
  doSomething();
} catch (MyException $e) {
  echo $e;
} catch (MySubException $e) { // Noncompliant: MySubException is a subclass of MyException
  echo "Never executed";
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
class MyException extends Exception {}
class MySubException extends MyException {}

try {
  doSomething();
} catch (MySubException $e) {
  echo "Executed";
} catch (MyException $e) {
  echo $e;
}
</pre>
