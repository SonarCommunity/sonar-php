<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Nested code - blocks of code inside blocks of code - is eventually necessary, but increases complexity. This is why keeping the code as flat as
possible, by avoiding unnecessary nesting, is considered a good practice.</p>
<p>Merging <code>if</code> statements when possible will decrease the nesting of the code and improve its readability.</p>
<p>Code like</p>
<pre>
if (condition1) {
  if (condition2) {             // Noncompliant
    ...
  }
}
</pre>
<p>Will be more readable as</p>
<pre>
if (condition1 &amp;&amp; condition2) { // Compliant
  ...
}
</pre>
