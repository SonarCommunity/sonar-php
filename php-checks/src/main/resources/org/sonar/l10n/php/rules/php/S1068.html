<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>If a <code>private</code> field is declared but not used locally, its limited visibility makes it dead code.</p>
<p>This is either a sign that some logic is missing or that the code should be cleaned.</p>
<p>Cleaning out dead code decreases the size of the maintained codebase, making it easier to understand and preventing bugs from being introduced.</p>
<pre>
class MyClass {
  private $foo = 4;            // Noncompliant: foo is unused and should be removed

  public function compute($a) {
    return $a * 4;
  }
}
</pre>
