<p>
  Empty statements, i.e. <code>;</code>, are usually introduced by mistake, for example because:
<ul>
  <li>It was meant to be replaced by an actual statement, but this was forgotten.</li>
  <li>There was a typo which lead the semicolon to be doubled, i.e. <code>;;</code>.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<p>The following code snippet illustrates this rule with a maximum number of 4 parameters:</p>
<pre>
function doSomething() {
  ;                                             // Noncompliant - was used as a kind of TODO marker
}

function doSomethingElse($p) {
  echo $p;;                                     // Noncompliant - double ;
}

for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; doSomething($i), $i++);  // Noncompliant - Rarely, they are used on purpose as the body of a loop. It is a bad practice to have side-effects outside of the loop body
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
function doSomething() {}

function doSomethingElse($p) {
  echo $p;

  for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    doSomething($i);
  }
}
</pre>
