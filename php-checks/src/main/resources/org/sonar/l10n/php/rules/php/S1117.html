<p>This rule is deprecated, and will eventually be removed.</p>
<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Overriding or shadowing a variable declared in an outer scope can strongly impact the readability, and therefore the maintainability, of a piece of
code. Further, it could lead maintainers to introduce bugs because they think theyâ€™re using one variable but are really using another.</p>
<pre>
class Foo {
  public $myField;

  public function doSomething() {
    $myField = 0; // Noncompliant
    ...
  }
}
</pre>
