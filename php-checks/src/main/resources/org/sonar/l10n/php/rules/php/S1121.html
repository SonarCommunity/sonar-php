<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>A common code smell that can hinder the clarity of source code is making assignments within sub-expressions. This practice involves assigning a
value to a variable inside a larger expression, such as within a loop or a conditional statement.</p>
<p>This practice essentially gives a side-effect to a larger expression, thus making it less readable. This often leads to confusion and potential
errors.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>This rule ignores assignments in conditions of <code>while</code> statements and assignments enclosed in relational expressions.</p>
<pre>
while (($line = next_line()) != NULL) {...}

while ($line = next_line()) {...}
</pre>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Making assignments within sub-expressions can hinder the clarity of source code.</p>
<p>This practice essentially gives a side-effect to a larger expression, thus making it less readable. This often leads to confusion and potential
errors.</p>
<p>Extracting assignments into separate statements is encouraged to keep the code clear and straightforward.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
if (($val = value()) &amp;&amp; check()) { // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
$val = value();
if ($val &amp;&amp; check()) {
}
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
if ($val == value() &amp;&amp; check()) { // Original intention might have been to use equality operator and not assignment
}
</pre>
