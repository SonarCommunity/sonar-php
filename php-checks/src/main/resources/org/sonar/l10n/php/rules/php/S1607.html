<p>When a test fails due, for example, to infrastructure issues, you might want to ignore it temporarily. But without some kind of notation about why
the test is being ignored, it may never be reactivated. Such tests are difficult to address without comprehensive knowledge of the project, and end up
polluting their projects.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue for each ignored test that does not have a comment message about why it is marked as incomplete or being skipped</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
protected function setUp() {
  if (!extension_loaded('mysqli')) {
    $this-&gt;markTestSkipped(); // Noncompliant
  }
}

public function testSomething()
{
  $this-&gt;assertTrue($result-&gt;isValid());
  $this-&gt;markTestIncomplete(); // Noncompliant
}

</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
protected function setUp() {
  if (!extension_loaded('mysqli')) {
    $this-&gt;markTestSkipped( 'The MySQLi extension is not available.' ); // Compliant
  }
}

public function testSomething()
{
  $this-&gt;assertTrue($result-&gt;isValid());
  $this-&gt;markTestIncomplete( 'Testing result validation is incomplete.' ); // Compliant
}
</pre>
