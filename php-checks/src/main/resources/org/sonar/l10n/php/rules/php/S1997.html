<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate efficiently. To avoid the confusion that can be caused by tangling two coding languages in the
same file, inline HTML should be avoided.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
&lt;?php
$name = "George";
?&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Hello &lt;?php echo $name ?&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>File having the extension <code>.phtml</code> are ignored by this rule because they are expected to have mixed PHP and HTML.</p>
