<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>At root, <code>require</code>, <code>require_once</code>, <code>include</code>, and <code>include_once</code> all perform the same task of
including one file in another. However, the way they perform that task differs, and they should not be used interchangeably.</p>
<ul>
  <li> <code>require</code> includes a file but generates a fatal error if an error occurs in the process. </li>
  <li> <code>include</code> also includes a file, but generates only a warning if an error occurs. </li>
</ul>
<p>Predictably, the difference between <code>require</code> and <code>require_once</code> is the same as the difference between <code>include</code>
and <code>include_once</code>. The <code>_once</code> versions ensure that the specified file is only included once.</p>
<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>
<p>Including the same file multiple times could have unpredictable results, the <code>_once</code> versions are preferred. Additionally, as
<code>include_once</code> generates only warnings, it should be used only when the file is being included conditionally, i.e. when all possible error
conditions have been checked beforehand.</p>
<h2>How to fix it</h2>
<p>Rewrite your code to only contain <code>require_once</code> and conditional <code>include_once</code> calls.</p>
<h3>Code examples</h3>
<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="noncompliant">
include 'code.php';  //Noncompliant; not a "_once" usage and not conditional
include $user.'_history.php'; // Noncompliant
require 'more_code.php';  // Noncompliant; not a "_once" usage
</pre>
<h4>Compliant solution</h4>
<pre data-diff-id="1" data-diff-type="compliant">
require_once 'code.php';
if (is_member($user)) {
  include_once $user.'_history.php';
}
require_once 'more_code.php';
</pre>
