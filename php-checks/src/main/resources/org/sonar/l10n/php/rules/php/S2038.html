<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Shared coding conventions allow teams to collaborate effectively. Writing colors in upper case makes them stand out at such, thereby making the
code easier to read.</p>
<p>This rule checks that hexadecimal color definitions are written in upper case.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
$white = '#ffffff';  // Noncompliant
$dkgray = '#006400';
$aqua = '#00ffff';  // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
$white = '#FFFFFF';  // Compliant
$dkgray = '#006400';
$aqua = '#00FFFF';  // Compliant
</pre>
