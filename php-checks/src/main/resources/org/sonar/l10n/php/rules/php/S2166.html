<p>Clear, communicative naming is important in code. It helps maintainers and API users understand the intentions for and uses of a unit of code.
Using "exception" in the name of a class that does not extend <code>Exception</code> or one of its subclasses is a clear violation of the expectation
that a class' name will indicate what it is and/or does.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
class FruitException {  // Noncompliant; this has nothing to do with Exception
  private $expected;
  private $unusualCharacteristics;
  private $appropriateForCommercialExploitation;
  // ...
}

class CarException {  // Noncompliant; the extends clause was forgotten?
  public function __construct(string message, Throwable cause) {
  // ...
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
class FruitSport {
  private $expected;
  private $unusualCharacteristics;
  private $appropriateForCommercialExploitation;
  // ...
}

class CarException extends Exception {
  public function __construct(string message, Throwable cause) {
  // ...
</pre>
