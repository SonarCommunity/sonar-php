<p>There's no point in having a PHPUnit test case without any test methods. Similarly, you shouldn't have a file in the tests directory which extends
PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase but no tests in the file. Doing either of these things may lead someone to think that uncovered classes have been
tested.</p>
