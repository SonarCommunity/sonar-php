<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p>Calling the <code>!</code> or <code>~</code> prefix operator twice does nothing: the second invocation undoes the first. Such mistakes are
typically caused by accidentally double-tapping the key in question without noticing. Either this is a bug, if the operator was actually meant to be
called once, or misleading if done on purpose.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
$a = 0;
$b = false;

$c = !!$a; // Noncompliant
$d = ~~$b; // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h3>Compliant solution</h3>
<pre>
$a = 0;
$b = false;

$c = !$a; // Compliant
$d = ~$b; // Compliant
</pre>
