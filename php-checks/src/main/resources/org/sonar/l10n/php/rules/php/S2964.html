<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>
<p><code>sleep</code> is sometimes used in a mistaken attempt to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by throttling response rate. But because it
ties up a thread, each request takes longer to serve that it otherwise would, making the application <em>more</em> vulnerable to DoS attacks, rather
than less.</p>
<h3>Noncompliant code example</h3>
<pre>
if (is_bad_ip($requester)) {
  sleep(5);  // Noncompliant
}
