<p>When a cookie is configured with the <code>HttpOnly</code> attribute set to <em>true</em>, the browser guaranties that no client-side script will
be able to read it. In most cases, when a cookie is created, the default value of <code>HttpOnly</code> is <em>false</em> and it’s up to the developer
to decide whether or not the content of the cookie can be read by the client-side script. As a majority of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks target
the theft of session-cookies, the <code>HttpOnly</code> attribute can help to reduce their impact as it won’t be possible to exploit the XSS
vulnerability to steal session-cookies.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself Whether</h2>
<ul>
  <li> the cookie is sensitive, used to authenticate the user, for instance a <em>session-cookie</em> </li>
  <li> the <code>HttpOnly</code> attribute offer an additional protection (not the case for an <em>XSRF-TOKEN cookie</em> / CSRF token for example)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>There is a risk if you answered yes to any of those questions.</p>
<h2>Recommended Secure Coding Practices</h2>
<ul>
  <li> By default the <code>HttpOnly</code> flag should be set to <em>true</em> for most of the cookies and it’s mandatory for session /
  sensitive-security cookies. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Sensitive Code Example</h2>
<p>In <em>php.ini</em> you can specify the flags for the session cookie which is security-sensitive:</p>
<pre>
session.cookie_httponly = 0;  // Sensitive: this sensitive session cookie is created with the httponly flag set to false and so it can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability
</pre>
<p>Same thing in PHP code:</p>
<pre>
session_set_cookie_params($lifetime, $path, $domain, true, false);  // Sensitive: this sensitive session cookie is created with the httponly flag (the fifth argument) set to false and so it can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability
</pre>
<p>If you create a custom security-sensitive cookie in your PHP code:</p>
<pre>
$value = "sensitive data";
setcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, true, false); // Sensitive: this sensitive cookie is created with the httponly flag (the seventh argument) set to false  and so it can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability
</pre>
<p>By default <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.setcookie.php"><code>setcookie</code></a> and <a
href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.setrawcookie.php"><code>setrawcookie</code></a> functions set <code>httpOnly</code> flag to
<em>false</em> (the seventh argument) and so cookies can be stolen easily in case of XSS vulnerability:</p>
<pre>
$value = "sensitive data";
setcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, true); // Sensitive: a sensitive cookie is created with the httponly flag  (the seventh argument) not defined (by default set to false)
setrawcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, true); // Sensitive: a sensitive cookie is created with the httponly flag (the seventh argument) not defined  (by default set to false)
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
session.cookie_httponly = 1; // Compliant: the sensitive cookie is protected against theft thanks (cookie_httponly=1)
</pre>
<pre>
session_set_cookie_params($lifetime, $path, $domain, true, true); // Compliant: the sensitive cookie is protected against theft thanks to the fifth argument set to true (HttpOnly=true)
</pre>
<pre>
$value = "sensitive data";
setcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, true, true); // Compliant: the sensitive cookie is protected against theft thanks to the seventh argument set to true (HttpOnly=true)
setrawcookie($name, $value, $expire, $path, $domain, true, true); // Compliant: the sensitive cookie is protected against theft thanks to the seventh argument set to true (HttpOnly=true)
</pre>
