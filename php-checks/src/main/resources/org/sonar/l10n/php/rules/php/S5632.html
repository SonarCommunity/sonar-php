<p>Instances of classes that do not derive from the "Throwable" interface cannot be used in a PHP "throw" statement.</p>
<p>Many built-in exceptions such as "Exception" and the SPL exception classes do implement the "Throwable" interface and can be extended when creating
custom exceptions.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when an instance of a class that does not implement the "Throwable" interface is used in a "throw" statement .</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
class NoThrowable {}

throw new NoThrowable(); // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
&lt;?php

class SomeThrowable implements Throwable {
    // Implementation of the Throwable methods
}

throw new SomeThrowable(); // Compliant

class SomeCustomException extends Exception {}

throw new SomeCustomException(); // Compliant{code}
</pre>
