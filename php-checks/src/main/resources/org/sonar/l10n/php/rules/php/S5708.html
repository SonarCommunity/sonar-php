<p>Instances of classes that do not derive from the "Throwable" interface cannot be used in a PHP "throw" statement. Thus, it does not make sense to
try to catch such objects within a "try-catch" block.</p>
<p>Many built-in exceptions such as "Exception" and the SPL exception classes do implement the "Throwable" interface and can be extended when creating
custom exceptions.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when the classes used to specify the type of objects to be caught in a "try-catch" block do not derive from "Throwable"
.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
class NoThrowable {}

try {
    foo();
} catch (NoThrowable $e) { // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
&lt;?php

class SomeThrowable implements Throwable {
    // Implementation of the Throwable methods
}

try {
    foo();
} catch (SomeThrowable $e) { // Compliant
}

class SomeCustomException extends Exception {}

try {
    foo();
} catch (SomeCustomException $e) { // Compliant
}{code}
