<p>Possessive quantifiers in Regex patterns like below improve performance by eliminating needless backtracking:</p>
<pre>
?+ , *+ , ++ , {n}+ , {n,}+ , {n,m}+
</pre>
<p>But because possessive quantifiers do not keep backtracking positions and never give back, the following sub-patterns should not match only similar
characters. Otherwise, possessive quantifiers consume all characters that could have matched the following sub-patterns and nothing remains for the
following sub-patterns.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
<code data-lang="php">"/a++abc/"              // Noncompliant, the second 'a' never matches
"/\d*+[02468]/"         // Noncompliant, the sub-pattern "[02468]" never matches</code>
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
<code data-lang="php">"/aa++bc/"              // Compliant, for example it can match "aaaabc"
"/\d*+(?&lt;=[02468])/"    // Compliant, for example it can match an even number like "1234"</code>
</pre>
