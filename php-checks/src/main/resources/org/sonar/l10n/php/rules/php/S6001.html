<p>When a back reference in a regex refers to a capturing group that hasn’t been defined yet (or at all), it can never be matched. Named back
references throw a warning in that case; numeric back references fail silently when they can’t match, simply making the match fail.</p>
<p>When the group is defined before the back reference but on a different control path (like in <code>(.)|\1</code> for example), this also leads to a
situation where the back reference can never match.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
preg_match("/\\1(.)/", $str); // Noncompliant, group 1 is defined after the back reference
preg_match("/(.)\\2/", $str); // Noncompliant, group 2 isn't defined at all
preg_match("/(.)|\\1/", $str); // Noncompliant, group 1 and the back reference are in different branches
preg_match("/(?&lt;x&gt;.)|\k&lt;x&gt;/", $str); // Noncompliant, group x and the back reference are in different branches
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
preg_match("/(.)\\1/", $str);
preg_match("/(?&lt;x&gt;.)\\k&lt;x&gt;/", $str);
</pre>
