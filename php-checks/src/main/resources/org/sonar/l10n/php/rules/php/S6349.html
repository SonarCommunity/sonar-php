<p>WordPress relies a lot on the configuration located in a file named <code>wp-config.php</code>. This file contains mostly <code>define</code>
statements and each of them creates a constant for a given WordPress option. However, no warning appears if an option is misspelled: the statement
simply defines a constant which is never used.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when a file named <code>wp-config.php</code> defines a constant whose name is slightly different from a known WordPress
option.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
define( 'DISALLOW_FILE_MOD', true ); // Noncompliant
define( 'Disallow_File_Mods', true ); // Noncompliant
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
define( 'DISALLOW_FILE_MODS', true );
</pre>
