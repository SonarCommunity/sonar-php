<p>A hard-coded secret has been found in your code. You should quickly list where this secret is used, revoke it, and then change it in every system
that uses it.</p>
<p>Passwords, secrets, and any type of credentials should only be used to authenticate a single entity (a person or a system).</p>
<p>If you allow third parties to authenticate as another system or person, they can impersonate legitimate identities and undermine trust within the
organization.<br> It does not matter if the impersonation is malicious: In either case, it is a clear breach of trust in the system, as the systems
involved falsely assume that the authenticated entity is who it claims to be.<br> The consequences can be catastrophic.</p>
<p>Keeping credentials in plain text in a code base is tantamount to sharing that password with anyone who has access to the source code and runtime
servers.<br> Thus, it is a breach of trust, as these individuals have the ability to impersonate others.</p>
<p>Secret management services are the most efficient tools to store credentials and protect the identities associated with them.<br> Cloud providers
and on-premise services can be used for this purpose.</p>
<p>If storing credentials in a secret data management service is not possible, follow these guidelines:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Do not store credentials in a file that an excessive number of people can access.
    <ul>
      <li> For example, not in code, not in a spreadsheet, not on a sticky note, and not on a shared drive. </li>
    </ul>  </li>
  <li> Use the production operating system to protect password access control.
    <ul>
      <li> For example, in a file whose permissions are restricted and protected with chmod and chown. </li>
    </ul>  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
use Defuse\Crypto\KeyOrPassword;

function createKey() {
    $password = "example";
    return KeyOrPassword::createFromPassword($password); // Noncompliant
}
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<p>Modern web frameworks tend to provide a secure way to pass passwords and secrets to the code. For example, in Symfony you can use <a
href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/configuration/secrets.html">vaults</a> to store your secrets. The secret values are referenced in the same way
as environment variables, so you can easily access them through <a
href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/configuration.html#configuration-parameters">configuration parameters</a>.</p>
<pre>
use Defuse\Crypto\KeyOrPassword;

class PasswordService
{
    private string $password;

    public function setPassword(string $password): void
    {
        $this-&gt;password = $password;
    }

    public function createKey(): KeyOrPassword
    {
        return KeyOrPassword::createFromPassword($this-&gt;password);
    }
}
</pre>
